## Overview
This Task Management System addresses the challenge of developing an application that enables efficient task tracking. The system should provide a REST API backend and frontend interface that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks with properties including title, description, status, and due dates. The implementation should follow best practices with comprehensive testing, database integration, validation, error handling, and documented API endpoints..

## The Process
Picking the stack:
  Backend Technology Choice: Node.js & Express
Why Node.js & Express:
- Good at handling lots of connections at once.
- Express is great for building REST APIs with simple routing.
- Makes it easy to add middleware for things like error handling.
- Can test the API on its own without the frontend.
- Keeps frontend and backend code separate which feels cleaner.
  
Both approaches share these benefits:
- Can use JavaScript everywhere which means less context switching.
- Tonnes of npm packages available to help build features.
- TypeScript works well with both.
- Similar testing approaches.
  
What Next.js offers:
- Everything in one place (frontend and backend together).
- Simpler to deploy as one app.
- API routes built right in.
- I chose Node.js with Express because I wanted to try a different approach after using Next.js before, and I liked the idea of having a separate backend and frontend.

Database Choice: Supabase
- Generous free tier with no time limit.
- Ready to use auth features if needed.
- Built on PostgreSQL - reliable, powerful queries.
- Realtime updates if needed.
- Intuitive dashboard.
- I have some familiarity with it.
